    <h2>Feature Extraction For Speech Recognition :-:</h2>
    <p><b>objective:-</b>In speaker independent speech recognition, a premium is placed on extracting features
        that are some what invariant to changes in the speaker. So feature extraction involves analysis of
        speech signal. Broadly the feature extraction techniques are classified as temporal analysis and
        spectral analysis technique. In temporal analysis the speech waveform itself is used for analysis.
        In spectral analysis spectral representation of speech signal is used for analysis.
